# mushroom_classification
The goal of this project is to classify mushrooms as edible (e) or poisonous (p) based on 20 descriptive features such as cap shape, cap color, stem characteristics, habitat, and season.
This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is the mushroom class (edible or poisonous).

## Final Deliverables
1. Preprocessed dataset ready for classification.
2. Performance evaluation of six classification models.
3. Insights on class imbalance and handling techniques.
4. Feature selection results (filter, wrapper, and embedded methods).
5. Hyperparameter tuning results from Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.
6. Feature importance ranking for better model interpretability.
7. Final comparison and recommendation of the best-performing model for mushroom classification.
8. pickle files of the saved models
